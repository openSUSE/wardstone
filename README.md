# `wardstone`

![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/tshakalekholoane/wardstone/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)

The `wardstone` project aims to create a library that can be used across different programming languages via a foreign function interface and a command line utility that users can run against their existing keys to detect conformance to varying cryptographic key standards and research publications.

The repository is organised as a series of the following Rust crates:

- [`wardstone_core`](./crates/core/)
- [`wardstone_ffi`](./crates/ffi/)

This is a [Google Summer of Code project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023/projects/QjOBHrdT) with [openSUSE](https://github.com/openSUSE/mentoring/issues/198).
